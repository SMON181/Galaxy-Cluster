 <h1>The Orion Nebula (messier-42) </h1>

 <div id="Text1" >
    Otherwise known as M42, this stellar nursery is the closest to earth at a distance of 1,500 light years away (Picture on the left). Mayan culture believed that M42 was a fiery zone of creation - which is not far from the truth. A stellar nursery is a collection of dust and gas that bound together with gravity. It contains the ingredients for a star to form from. The gravity of the dust and gas pulls itself together, gradually increasing in density over time. When the density becomes high enough-called the  _limit, a star is born and it will be able to start fusing hydrogen into helium.

<div>Pictured right, here are two images of a protoplanetry disk around a newborn star that is believed to have formed in the orion nebula. A protoplanetary disk is a misnomer - it is a disk of dust orbiting a new star, Herbig Ae/Be star or a T-Tauri star-not a planet. Pictured below the protoplanetary disk, is one of my favorite deep . </div>

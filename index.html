 <h1>The Orion Nebula (messier-42) </h1>
 <div id="Text1">
    Otherwise known as m42, this stellar nursery is the closest to earth at a distance of 1,500 light years away. Mayan culture believed that M42 was a fiery zone of creation - which is not far from the truth. A stellar nursery is a collection of dust and gas that bound together with gravity. It contains the ingredients for a star to form from. The gravity of the dust and gas pulls itself together, gradually increasing in density over time. When the density becomes high enough-called the  _limit, a star is born and it will be able to start fusing hydrogen into helium.

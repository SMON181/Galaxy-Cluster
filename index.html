    Also known as M42, this stellar nursery is the closest to earth at a distance of 1,500 light years away (Picture on the left). Mayan culture believed that M42 was a fiery zone of creation - which is not far from the truth. A stellar nursery is a collection of dust and gas that is bound together with gravity. It contains the ingredients for a star to form from. The gravity of the dust and gas pulls itself together, gradually increasing in density over time. When the density becomes high enough, called the  hydrogen-burning limit, a star is born and it will begin to fuse hydrogen into helium.

  On the left, here are two images of a protoplanetry disk orbiting around a newborn star that is believed to have formed in the Orion Nebula. A protoplanetary disk is a misnomer - it is usually a disk of dust orbiting a new star-not a planet.

My website about Space!
It presents information for you to see in neat little pockets of information. It is designed to be way less visually overwhelming than a textbook.
It has cool graphics, like the randomly generate, twinkly stars!

Images and some knowledge from:
"https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/orion-nebula-xlarge_web-jpg.webp"  
Keep in mind, a large portion of the writing is from background knowledge.


Math for the stars to twinkle and generate randomly is done with some aid from chatgpt, while all other code is done by me.
